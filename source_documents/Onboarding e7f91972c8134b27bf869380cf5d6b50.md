# Donut

Donut is a little Slack app that will ping you with a few things to do during onboarding. Most of these are introductions to the team and reminders to schedule certain things. 

# PEOCanada

During your first week, PEOCanada will be in touch to onboard you. They handle payroll and benefits, as well as HR (everything you see in [HR policies](https://www.notion.so/HR-Policies-Expenses-6328d9aa141a411d8eeaa0856f66d149?pvs=21) is written by them). 

# FAQ

### Who appears on my pay stub?

Pay stubs and tax forms will have "AlleyCorp Nord Inc." on them, but the payment in your bank account will  come from PEOCanada. 

### When is payroll?

Payroll is every two weeks (dates are variable) on Fridays. If Friday is a holiday, the pay may be moved up or down by a few days. PEOCanada has a calendar of pay days. 

### When does health insurance kick in?

Right away because your health doesn't care how long you've been at a job. You should hear from PEOCanada/Great West Life during your first week. It is very important that you fill in the forms and register for your insurance within 30 days of your start date.

### **What's our address?**

It's our law firm's office. 3500-800 du Square-Victoria Montréal Québec H4Z1E9 Canada

### How should I list my job on LinkedIn?

You are under no obligation to list anything in particular! However, if you'd like to, it's nice to link yourself to ACN, and you can also display the incubation you work on — though in that case it's nice if you mention it's via AlleyCorp Nord.
