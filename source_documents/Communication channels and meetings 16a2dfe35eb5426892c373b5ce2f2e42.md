# Communication channels and meetings

# Slack

Slack is used for daily communication.

Slack should be treated as ephemeral (even if it is not). Back-to-back announcements should be sent via email and technical decisions should be documented in Notion or the appropriate project documentation tool.

Everyone is encouraged to use Do Not Disturb as well as status to best manage their work. 

## #announcements

The #announcements channel is locked, and only managers and HR can post to it.

Please enable notifications for #announcements to receive an alert for important company updates.

## #general

Anyone can post on general, but remember to keep it work-related.

Good topics for #general:

- "Does anyone know where I can find a policy for ___?"
- "I created a new channel for ___, join if you want!"

## Other channels

## #education

This channel has posts about educational books, conferences, etc.

## #random

Anyone can post on this channel. 

Donut will ask watercooler topic questions here like: 

- What’s a song you loved as a teenager?
- What’s your favorite childhood movie you still love to watch as an adult?

## #social

This channel is for planning social events.

## #weather

The channel where we discuss all things weather.

## #our-furry-furiends

The channel where we post all things related to our pets.

# Email

The group [team@alleycorpnord.com](mailto:team@alleycorpnord.com) can be used to share resources or send messages to all team members.

# Meetings & Events

**A note on calendars:**

We use team@alleycorpnord.com for full-team recurring event invites. [Unfortunately,](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/172013?hl=en) due to Google Calendar restrictions, events sent to a group won’t show up on an individual team member’s calendar unless they accept the invitation. So, please search your email for invitations to events with the names below, accept, and from that point on you can decline individual instances as needed.

## All Hands

We have an all-hands meeting every other Tuesday at 4pm EDT.

Tuesday tea time replaces lunch and learns in the event of a work-from-home pandemic.

**Each week**, one or more team members present something - from a lightning talk (<10 min) to a full presentation to a project demo.

Members of the "extended" community are invited, e.g. engineers and designers from some of the companies we work with.

Some guidelines:

- Focus on education, but CHILL. You don't need to spend much time preparing.
- Drop down list of topics with some sort of light registration/agenda
- Supporting documents
