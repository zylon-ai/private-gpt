## Local Installation steps

The steps in [Installation](/installation) section are better explained and cover more
setup scenarios (macOS, Windows, Linux).
But if you like one-liners, have python3.11 installed, and you are running a UNIX (macOS or Linux)
system, you can get up and running on CPU in few lines:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT && cd privateGPT && \
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && \
pip install --upgrade pip poetry && poetry install --with ui,local && ./scripts/setup

# Launch the privateGPT API server **and** the gradio UI
python3.11 -m private_gpt

# In another terminal, create a new browser window on your private GPT!
open http:////127.0.0.1:8001/
```

The above is not working, or it is too slow, so **you want to run it on GPU(s)**?
Please check the more detailed [installation guide](/installation).
